## About Me

I work as a teacher but I feel like I cannot take it anymore. Someday I want to become a Front-End developer so that is the reason why I am here. I have not much spare time but every free minute will be devoted to study. They say it is never to late. Well, I'm in.

## Skills

It is a very strong word. Actually, I'm just studying and can do a little bit.
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript (Basic)
* Git

## Code Example

It was the first step on Codewars.
```javascript
const greet = (text) =>{
  text = 'hello world!';
return text;
};
```
This kata is just liked.
```javascript
const rentalCarCost = (days) => days >= 7 ? days * 40 - 50 : days >= 3 ? days * 40 - 20 : days * 40;
```

## Cources

In addition to JS / FRONT-END
* Code basics: HTML for beginners
* Code basics: CSS for beginners

## English Level
Three years ago I passed IELTS and got 6.5. So my level is B2. During recent years I did not improve it but as well not give it up.
